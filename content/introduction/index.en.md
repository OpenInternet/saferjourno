The original SaferJourno was launched in 2014 with the aim of bolstering the digital security capacity of trainers working with journalists around the world. For this new and updated version this aim has not changed, but the content has. 

Journalists face a complex array of digital threats. Some of these are old, such as account hacking and malware attacks, but others are new and present significant challenges. This includes the increasing use of sophisticated spyware as well as state-sponsored online smear campaigns designed to undermine a journalist and their reporting. This guide provides trainers with best practice on how to mitigate these risks in a way that is both practical and accessible for the journalist. 

The guide is designed for both experienced digital security trainers as well as for other trainers looking to teach digital safety for the first time. We have created tailored guidance for trainers looking to learn more about how journalists work as well as detailed digital security steps for those who are new to the topic. SaferJourno has a range of activities for both beginners and advanced-level trainers. Trainers should feel free to mix and match our activities with their own as well as using our scenarios and real-life case studies. Understanding and reducing risk is an important part of keeping journalists safe. This is why this new version of SaferJourno has a tailored digital-security risk assessment that works both as a stand-alone document as well as to be taught with each chapter of the guide.
