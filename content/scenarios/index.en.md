The following scenarios are designed to accompany the course and can be used to help participants consolidate their learning. These activities work well in a group setting with journalists encouraged to share ideas and best practice with each other. Trainers should feel free to adapt the materials as they see fit.

## Scenario I

### Protecting mobile phones and sensitive materials

**For the trainer**

This scenario covers both device security and secure materials, however, It is possible to use this scenario to teach only one of these topics. Detailed best practice guidance on these topics can be found in chapter three and chapter five of the guide and can be used to teach this section.

**The scenario**

You are a reporter working for a local newspaper. You are incredibly busy at work because it is an election period. You are working long hours and filing more articles than normal. Your local politician is standing for re-election and you are being sent to cover her speech later on today. Her election rallies are quite hostile places for journalists as she uses a lot of anti-media rhetoric in her speeches. The crowd will not be friendly to journalists and neither will the law enforcement agencies who will be there to police it. You will be carrying your personal phone and a notebook, and are planning to both take notes and make recordings. You are not sure what content is on your phone and you are short on time. You were previously involved in investigating the politician around issues of corruption.
