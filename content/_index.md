SaferJourno is the flagship journalist security guide developed and maintained by [Internews](https://internews.org/). It aims to upskill both digital security trainers who would like to start working with journalists, and media trainers who want to start working on digital security. Created in 2014 and significantly revised in 2024, SaferJourno has proven a crucial resource for newsrooms and trainers across the world.

We plan to regularly read through and revise SaferJourno to make sure that it conforms to current knowledge about technology, threats, and security. We completed the most recent round of revisions in **October 2025**.
