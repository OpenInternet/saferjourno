Journalists face a wide-array of digital risks when carrying out their work and completing a risk assessment is an important factor when it comes to keeping data and sources safer. This risk assessment template is designed to get you thinking about the risks that you face as well as the steps you need to take to reduce that risk. 

This template can be completed as a stand-alone document or as part of the SaferJourno training course. Journalists may need to consult the SaferJourno guide for best practice guidance on how to carry out certain digital security steps. You may not need to complete all of the risk assessment, choose the sections or questions that best suit your security needs.
