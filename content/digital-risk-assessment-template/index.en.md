Journalists face a wide array of digital risks when carrying out their work. Completing a risk assessment is an important factor when it comes to keeping data and sources safer. This risk assessment template is designed to get you thinking about the risks that you face as well as the steps you need to take to reduce that risk. 

You can complete the risk assessment template on your own, or together with others you work with, such as an editor or security officer. Journalists may need to consult the SaferJourno guide for best practice guidance on how to carry out certain digital security steps. You may not need to complete all of the risk assessment, choose the sections or questions that best suit your security needs.

Think about where you will store this document and how you will share it securely with the news outlet you are working with. Consult with a digital security advisor if you need guidance on how to do this.

## Thinking about general digital risk

What general digital safety concerns do you have?

Have you faced any previous digital threats? Please detail if you feel comfortable to do so.

Are you living or working in a country with a high level of surveillance? What steps do you need to take in order to be digitally more secure?  

Are you working on a sensitive story? If so, what do you need to know about your risks and adversaries to be safer online and when using devices?

## Account security

Do you know who may wish to target your accounts? If so, do you know if this adversary have a history of breaking into or carrying out phishing attacks against journalists or others?

Are you able to set up anti-phishing protections such as password manager autofill and physical security keys or passkeys? What sort of steps would you need to take to include those protections in your work and workflow?

Is there a risk the government could subpoena a company for your online information? If so, what steps will you take to protect your data?

- [ ] I have turned on two-factor authentication for my accounts, ideally with physical security keys or passkeys

- [ ] If I'm using a password manager, I've enabled auto-fill in my web browser to combat phishing threats
- [ ] I have reviewed the content of my most important accounts and removed anything I would not feel comfortable with others accessing
