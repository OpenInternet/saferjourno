## Introduction

Protecting devices and the content on them is an increasingly complicated issue for journalists and newsrooms, especially with the threat of ever-sophisticated spyware being used against reporters. These threats are compounded by the fact that journalists often mix personal and work content on their devices leaving both them and their sources open to attack. This session will provide journalists with the best practice guidance needed to better secure their devices and help them think through what steps they need to take based on their own threat assessment.

This chapter will cover:

- Thinking about individual risk when it comes to protecting devices
- Best practice for securing devices
- Protecting against malware
- Understanding how mobile phone operators and mobile phones work
- Guidance on spyware

## Training journalists for the first time?

The following can be helpful to keep in mind:

**General**

- Journalists more often than not are using their personal devices for work-related content.
- Money is an issue for journalists, especially freelancers, when it comes to buying new devices. Newsrooms are not always able or willing to provide staff with work devices. Smaller newsrooms also lack the expertise on how to manage and secure devices. Newsroom IT often focuses on basic functions, such as setting up email and computers, and can sometimes lack more specialised security experience, especially concerning threats against journalists.
- Media workers are likely to be using old devices, especially Android phones, which they often will not have updated. Media outlets may be using desktop computers which are using older versions of Microsoft software.
- The use of pirated software is very common among journalists in certain regions of the world.
- Journalists may be unaware of what content is being stored on their devices and where it is being backed up.

**Mobile phones**

- Journalists will more than likely be using their personal phone for work. The phone number will have been shared with a wide-range of contacts, which may include government officials, the authorities, and people who may be classed as hostile to the journalist.
- Journalists now do a significant amount of work on their mobile phone, including recording interviews, shooting video, and reviewing documents. In some countries, journalists will only be using a mobile phone for their work and will not have access to a computer.
- Sources will be reaching out to journalists and journalists will be accessing source data, including documents, normally via their mobile device.
- Journalists will have built up their contact list over years and they will not want to stop using their phone number. It is better to suggest that the journalist gets a new personal number and keep their original number for work.
- Think about whether the journalist needs more than one device or whether they only need an extra number.
- Be aware that, in some countries, having more than one phone or a SIM/ phone number issued in another country can make the journalist look suspicious.
- Many countries now have compulsory SIM registration, which means that you need to present a passport or similar document to get a SIM card.
- Journalists will generally not know how both a mobile phone or a mobile phone provider operate.

## Training digital security for the first time?

This section covers best practice that can be used when teaching the activities in this chapter. See the resources section in this chapter for further reading.

_General best practice_

- A journalist’s computer and mobile phone are a target for others who may want to obtain the information contained on them. This can happen in a number of ways including with malware, they can be seized by the authorities and searched, they can be accessed by others if left unattended, and they can be broken or stolen.
- Make journalists aware about how to protect their computers and mobile phones as a way to keep both the devices and the data on them safer. Prompt journalists to complete a risk assessment as part of following best practice guidance.
- It is important to always update the operating systems on devices. This corrects issues with the software and better protects the device from malware. It’s also important to update all apps and browsers too. Journalists should be encouraged to set their devices to carry out updates automatically, this can be turned on in the settings section of their devices.
- All devices should be protected with a password, PIN, or biometric lock. Which one the journalist uses will depend on their individual risk profile. Having a biometric lock activated on the devices makes it easy for the journalist to gain access to a device but it also makes it easier for others to access the device too. This will help protect against unauthorised access, but be aware that law enforcement may have the technical knowledge to unlock certain makes and models.
- Avoid leaving devices unattended, for example at conferences, in hotels, or in cafes. This will protect against people installing malware onto the device or accessing data if the screen is left unlocked.
- Having a process for backing up and removing content from both computers and mobile ensures that if devices are accessed then a minimal amount of content is obtained. You can see more about backing up materials in chapter five.

_Malware_

- Malware is software that is designed to cause damage to a device and/or to grant unauthorised access.
- There are many different types of malware including,
  - Viruses, an infection that replicates once on a device destroying data and/or corrupting the operating system
  - Spyware, malicious software that gathers information directly from the device and sends it to another entity
    - An example of spyware is a keylogger, a computer program that records every typed piece of content made by the user, including passwords.
  - Ransomware, software that blocks access to a device unless a ransom is paid
  - Trojan malware, a virus disguised as a legitimate program, for example an app, that once downloaded infects the device.

Devices can be infected by malware through the following:

- Clicking on malicious links or downloading documents that contain malware
- Installing programs or apps from providers that are not legitimate
- Browsing insecure websites
- Clicking on malicious ads that appear on websites.

You can protect against malware by doing the following:

- Follow best practice for clicking on links and/or downloading documents. For more about protecting against phishing take a look at chapter two.
- Only download programs and apps from legitimate sites and manufacturer approved stores, such as the Google Play Store and the Apple app store.
- Avoid visiting websites that are not encrypted or where illegal activity may be happening. See chapter four for information on how to best browse the web.
- Install and turn on an antivirus, for example the one that is included free with all operating systems.

_Computers_

- It is recommended to encrypt computers in order to protect the information contained on them. If a computer is encrypted then nobody can access the information on it without the password needed to decrypt the content. Be aware that law enforcement may request that the devices be decrypted
- When setting up a computer to encrypt it will require the user to create a password. It is better to think of this password in advance and to ensure that it follows the best practice for creating secure passwords. Information on this is available in chapter two.
- Backup all data on devices first before encrypting them.
- There are two different ways to encrypt a computer depending on whether it is a Windows PC or a Mac. Turning on encryption for Windows PC involves activating their encryption program called Bitlocker. You can read about how to do this [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/turn-on-device-encryption-0c453637-bc88-5f74-5105-741561aae838#:~:text=Or%2C%20select%20Start%20%3E%20Settings%20%3E,and%20then%20follow%20the%20instructions.). Mac users can turn on FireVault, the equivalent encryption program for Macs. Read more about encrypting Mac computers [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh11785/mac).
- Turn on the antivirus program that comes as standard with your computer’s operating system. These programs will scan your computer for viruses and alert you if a virus has been located.

_Mobile phones_

- Mobile phones are always connected to services around them in order to receive and transmit information. This includes mobile phone towers, internet connections, and Bluetooth. All of these connections give away data about the mobile phone users, including their location.

- What is a mobile phone made up of?

  - Antenna\
     Permits communication between the phone and the network
  - Battery\
     Powers the device and is no longer removable
  - Baseband microprocessor\
    Manages the communications of the phone, including commands from the user to the phone and from the phone to the mobile network
  - Bluetooth\
     A wireless technology that uses radio frequency to share data over a limited distance. It can be used on a phone to share documents and other data as well as to connect to other services offering Bluetooth
  - GPS\
     Stands for Global Positioning System. This is a receiver in the phone that connects with satellites. IT can be turned off in the settings section of the phone.
  - SIM and SIM slot\
     Where the SIM card is stored. Some phones have the option for a dual SIM card. Phones give the option of storing data on the SIM, on the device, or in apps and services on the phone.

- All mobile phone devices have a unique identity number called the Mobile Equipment Identity number, otherwise known as an IMEI. This number is used by telecommunications companies to identify a device and provide it a service on its network. The IMEI number can also be tracked using software. This can be used by people to locate lost or stolen devices. It can also be used by governments to locate people. This could be a risk for journalists if they are meeting with sensitive sources or are travelling to locations that they would rather others did not know about.
- All SIM cards also have a unique identity number known as the IMSI number. When the mobile phone card connects to the network it shares this number with the provider. The IMSI contains information about the SIM card, including the country in which it was issued. This information is available to mobile phone providers and makes it possible for them to know your location. This information can be shared with governments. For those living in countries where their ID number is tied to their SIM card this means the government knows which SIM card they are using. This is known as a registered SIM. Unregistered SIM cards are SIM cards that are not tied to your identity.
- A mobile phone gives away data about a journalist’s location and who they are communicating with. This data is collected by the telecommunications company and can be passed to governments. Telecommunications companies collect other data, including phone call history, the phone numbers of people you contact when making mobile phone calls and SMS messages.If they provide you with internet coverage they may also be obtaining data on your browsing history. This data can be accessed by people at the company and can also be obtained by governments.
- All iPhones are encrypted as standard whereas only some Android devices are. To activate encryption for an Android phone, ensure that the device is charged and plugged in, backup any content on the device first, and then follow the instructions in the settings section of the phone.
- As well as the best practice outlined above, in the section on general best practice, it is advised to take the following steps to secure your phone, data and phone number
  - Turn on encryption for your phone
  - Prevent messaging apps from showing the full message on your home screen. You can adjust this in the settings section of the phone.
  - Clear your browsing history
  - Put a PIN lock on your SIM card. You can follow the instructions in the settings section of your phone to do this. By putting a lock on your SIM card you prevent others from gaining control of your number. This is known as [SIM jacking](https://www.wired.com/story/sim-swap-attack-defend-phone/).
  - As well as putting a PIN lock on your SIM card, you should also put steps in place, a PIN or password, to protect the account you have with your mobile phone provider. To do this, call your provider and request that a security notification be put on your account and that nobody should have access to it without providing the PIN or password.
  - Turning off location tracking for apps and services
  - Setting up devices to remote wipe. Read about how to do this for Apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/icloud/mmfc0ef36f/icloud) and for Google [here](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6160491?hl=en).

_Spyware_

- Spyware is a form of malware that is normally used to infect mobile phones in order to obtain information. There are different types of spyware and they vary in how much data they can collect and the way in which they infect the phone.
- Sophisticated spyware is being increasingly used by governments to surveil journalists and their communications. Some examples of this type of spyware include Pegasus spyware and Predator spyware. You can read more about these types of spyware [here](https://citizenlab.ca/2021/12/pegasus-vs-predator-dissidents-doubly-infected-iphone-reveals-cytrox-mercenary-spyware/). Once this spyware is on a device all activity, including calls, email, and other apps linked to the device, can be monitored, recorded, and shared with others.
- To get spyware on a device, the adversary may target the user using sophisticated spear phishing techniques. You can read more about phishing and spear phishing in chapter two. Increasingly, spyware is being inserted onto a device with the user doing anything. This is known as a zero click attack.
- If spyware is on a device then all communications can be monitored, this includes any end-to-end encrypted services, such as Signal and WhatsApp. This is because it is the device itself that is compromised and the adversary is obtaining data directly from the phone.
- Apple devices are able to activate protection against spyware. This is called [Lockdown Mode](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT212650) and is available on iOS 16 for phones, computers and iPads. Journalists who are at high risk of being infected by spyware should turn this on for their devices. They should ensure that their family and others close to them also activate Lockdown Mode where possible.

- Other possibilities for protecting against spyware include:
  - Backup data regularly
  - Carrying out a factory reset of the phone and reinstalling all services. This may erase the spyware from the device.
  - Consider buying a number of cheap Android phones and using a different one each day, week or month defending on your level of risk. Ensure a factory reset is carried out before starting to use one.
  - Update the operating system, apps, and browsers regularly.

## Completing the risk assessment

When speaking about the risk assessment and personal security plan it may be helpful to touch upon the following:

- When getting journalists to think about device security, the trainer should help them to focus on what content is already on their devices and work with them to think of how they can create a process for backing up and removing information.
- Encourage the journalists to map out who may be interested in obtaining their devices and/or the content on their devices. This can include others who may already have physical access to the device, For example family members. Good questions to think about include, Who could unintentionally remove or delete content from my device and how can I protect against that? How likely is my device to be stolen or broken when I am out covering an event? Does my government have a history of using spyware and have they used it against journalists in my country? How likely is the government to detain me and take my devices?
- Understandably journalists are increasingly worried about being infected by spyware. It can be helpful to get them to think about their own risk profile and whether it fits with being targeted by spyware. For example, are they from a country where the government uses spyware? Talk about the different types of spyware and highlight that more sophisticated spyware is expensive which means it is not being deployed on a massive scale.

## Common questions asked

Below are some common questions that journalists ask about account security. It can be helpful to have answers to these prepared in advance.

**Do I really need a work phone, it’s such a pain carrying around two devices?!**

The important issue here is for the trainer to get the journalist thinking about what is at risk if they don’t separate out their work and their personal life on their devices. Based on this, journalists can make a judgement call on whether they need a new device or not. Good questions for the trainer to ask include, are your devices at risk of being confiscated or infected with targeted malware, do you have to contact highly sensitive contacts or people who may be breaking the law?

**How much does my mobile phone provider know about me?**

Explain that it is difficult to be one hundred percent sure around how much data a company is collecting. This is because the data they collect is often buried in lengthy terms and conditions set out by the company and they may also be sharing data with other companies without your knowledge. One step that journalists can take is to find out how long mobile phone providers are legally requested to keep data for in their country and also if and how they are sharing that data with governments. To find this out, they can carry out an online search with keywords, such as mobile phone data retention and government subpoena amongst others.

**If I delete content from my devices is there a way to recover it?**

Explain that there is always a way to recover data but this depends on the tech capacity of the people who may gain access to the devices. For example, a government. This is a good opportunity for journalists to assess who may be interested in obtaining their devices and to build this into their work plan for better securing their materials.

**How can I tell if there is spyware on my device?**

The trainer should first focus on getting the journalist to consider whether they are at high risk of having spyware on their devices. Good questions to ask include, whether they live in a country where the government has a history of using spyware, are they covering stories that put them more at risk of spyware, have they or anyone they know been targeted. Explain that there are different types of spyware and the only way to be sure if a device has been infected is to send it off to be forensically analysed. Trainers could research ahead of the class whether there are any threat labs—or organisations which can forensically analyse devices for non-profits—within their region.

## Learning outcomes

At the end of the session journalists:

- Know what content is on their devices and in accounts linked to their devices and understand how this could put them at risk.
- Are able to make informed decisions around what best practice to use based on their own risk profile
- Understand how to encrypt their computer and whether their phone needs encryption turned on or whether it comes with encryption as standard
- Better understand how mobile phones and mobile phone providers operate

## Templates and tools

The following templates and tools can be useful for teaching this session:

- Encryption services, such as Bitlocker and Filevault. More detailed information on this can be found at the beginning of this chapter.
- Apple [Lockdown Mode](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT212650) for protecting against spyware

## Activities

The activities below are designed to accompany this training session on device security. Trainers should feel free to use their own activities as well as to adapt the materials in this guide to best suit the needs of the journalists they are training. The number and type of activities selected will depend on the level of knowledge of the trainer as well as the amount of time the trainer has to spend with the participants. For those new to training in digital safety, don’t forget to review the section, Training digital security for the first time?, for best practice guidance.

### Getting started

**Step one**

- Put the journalists into pairs and hand out a pack of post-it notes.
- Then ask the journalists to think about what type of content they have on their devices. Ask them to write one piece of content on one post-it note. For example an email account, the content of the in-box and also the cloud account linked to the email account
- Give the journalists five minutes to complete the activity.
- Ask them to work with their partner to group the content into categories, for example, work documents, social media apps.

**Step two**

- Facilitate a discussion on what the journalists learned from doing this activity. Ask the following questions
  - Were you surprised by how much data was on your devices?
  - Did you learn anything surprising?
  - What information is at risk? What steps do you think you can take to protect it?

> Activity

_Trainer note: best practice for this activity can be found in the section, Training digital security for the first time?, located at the beginning of this chapter. The trainer may want to use local examples of how people have targeted devices, for example, devices seized during protests._

**Step one**

- Ask the journalists what steps they currently take to protect their devices.
  - Using their answers as a starting point go over the general best practice for protecting devices, including:
  - A brief overview of how people target devices
  - The importance of avoiding leaving devices unattended, for example in hotel rooms or conferences
  - Being mindful of what they plug into their devices, including USB sticks which could contain malware.
  - The importance of updating operating systems, apps and browsers when prompted to do so. Explain that this helps fix vulnerabilities with the code which can be exploited by bad actors.
  - Using an antivirus
  - Securing devices with passwords, pin locks, and biometrics. It can be helpful to discuss the pros and cons of these options based on the journalist’s own risk profile.
  - A brief look at phishing and malware. Detailed guidance on protecting against phishing is included in chapter two.
  - The importance of encrypting devices. Explain that this chapter will cover how to encrypt computers

With each of these steps it can be helpful to get journalists thinking about why they are carrying out this best practice and what it is protecting against in terms of their own risk analysis.

**Step two**

- Close the session by asking the journalists to think about and discuss the following questions
  - What do I feel I do well when it comes to securing my devices?
  - What do I need to do now to better secure my devices?

</div>

> Activity

_This exercise has been adapted from the Level Up chapter Malware and other malicious software._

_Trainer note: best practice for this activity can be found in the section, Training digital security for the first time?, located at the beginning of this chapter._

**Step one**

- Explain to participants what malware is, and review a few of the types of malware that exist. It is recommended to cover the following:
  - Trojan Horse
  - Spyware
  - Ransomware
  - Keylogger
  - Viruses

**Step two**

- Explain some of the most common ways that devices become infected with malware, and the unsafe practices that can lead to such infections.
- It is also important to explain the different purposes or motivations behind malware deployments:
  - Some malware is broadcast on a wide-scale with no particular target;
  - Other kinds are specifically targeted at activists, journalists or dissidents to gain access to their data or communications;
  - Still other kinds are targeted at individuals known to be connected to a number of activists, journalists or dissidents in the hope of infecting multiple targets across a network.

**Step three**

- Show local examples of different types of malware attacks and generate a discussion between participants on this issue. Questions you may want to speak about include, have you seen any of these types of attacks? Are journalists in this region targeted by this type of malware? Who is targeting you with these types of attacks?

**Step four**

- Ask the journalists what they are currently doing to protect against malware.
- Explain that one of the best ways to protect their computers is to turn on the antivirus that comes as standard with their operating system.
- Explain that malware is often downloaded onto devices via phishing attacks. The trainer may want to walk the journalists through best practice for protecting against phishing in chapter two.

#### III Encrypting a computer

</div>

> Activity

_Trainer note: this exercise is designed for advanced level trainers. Set up the tech in advance of the workshop. You will need a test computer for this activity. Show either FireVault for Mac or BitLocker for Widows PC depending on which computers the participants are most likely to be using._

_Best practice for this activity can be found in the section, Training digital security for the first time?, located at the beginning of this chapter._

**Step one**

- Ask the journalists why they think it is important to encrypt their computer. Find out whether anyone in the room has experience of encrypting their devices and/or what people know about the process of encryption.
- Explain that there are different ways to encrypt a computer based on whether the user is using Windows, BitLocker, or Mac, FireVault.

**Step two**

- Tell the journalists that you are going to give them a practical demonstration of encrypting a computer.
- Explain that it is good practice to backup the data on devices first before encrypting them.
- Explain that once the computer is encrypted it will need a password in order to gain access to the content on the device. This password is what the journalists use to log into the device so they should ensure that the password follows best practice for password creation as detailed in chapter two.
- Walk through the importance of creating and storing safely a backup key. Explain that if someone tries to gain access to the device and is unable to enter, the service will lock down the computer and will ask for the backup key in order to unlock it.
- Walk the journalist through the step by step process for encrypting the device.

**Step three**

- Answer any questions that the journalists may have.

#### IV How does your mobile device work?

**Step three**

- Put the journalists into groups and ask them to identify what risks carrying a mobile phone poses. For example, GPS tracking.
- Ask them to think about which of these risks are applicable in their own circumstances.
- Ask the journalists if they know of any local cases where journalists have been tracked using their mobile phone. The trainer may wish to provide some real-life examples here.

> Activity

_Trainer note: There is a lot of anxiety around spyware. Try to provide practical steps that journalists can take to protect against it._

_Best practice for this activity can be found in the section, Training digital security for the first time?, located at the beginning of this chapter. The trainer may want to use local examples of how devices have been infected with sophisticated spyware_

**Step one**

- Write up Pegasus on the board and ask the journalists what they know about it.
- Tell the journalists that they are going to read a case study of a journalist who was infected by Pegasus. After they have read the case study, discuss the case. You can use the following questions:

  - Have you had any similar cases in your region?
  - Why do you think the journalist was targeted?
  - What information do you think they were able to obtain for the journalist’s phone?

- Ask journalists to take some time to think and write down general content they may have on their phone or in their accounts that they would not want others to find. They do not have to feed this information back to the group if they are uncomfortable doing so. Tell them that the session will later deal with some best practice for better protecting that data.

- Give a general overview of spyware. It can be helpful to have slides and illustrations to talk about this.

  - Pegasus is one of many types of spyware
  - Spyware varies in how sophisticated it is and how it infects devices
  - Use examples to show the different ways that spyware has infected devices, including spear phishing attacks. More information on these types of attacks can be found in chapter two.
  - Talk about zero-click attacks.

- Walk journalists through some best practice for protecting against spyware. Points to mention can include:

  - You can never be one-hundred percent secure against spyware; there is only the option to manage risk. The more high-risk the journalist is in terms of spyware the more steps they will have to take to try and secure their devices.
  - Get the journalists to think about whether they are at high-risk for spyware, including considering the journalist’s location and use of spyware in that region, stories that they cover, the outlet they work for, how high profile they are.
  - Importance of updating devices to protect against malware
  - Carrying out a factory reset of the device if they are concerned it is infected. They should backup the device first before resetting.
  - Turning on [Lockdown Mode](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT212650) for Apple devices iOS 16
  - Limiting the amount of content on their phone, including apps. For example avoid linking their work email to their phone
  - Where possible have separate devices for work and personal use
  - Best practice for protecting against phishing attacks. Consult chapter two for more details on this.

- Close out the session by asking the following questions:
  - Do you feel you have a greater understanding of spyware?
  - What steps do you need to take to be more secure?

**Step two**

- Walk the journalists through best practice for protecting their mobile devices. This guidance can be found at the beginning of this chapter in the section, Training digital security for the first time? The trainer may want to speak about the following:
  - Encrypting the phone
  - Backing up and removing data from the device
  - Locking the phone
  - Setting up a device to remote wipe
  - Turning off location tracking
  - Erasing the browsing history
- Ask the journalists which of this best practice do they think is most applicable to them.

_Trainer note: you will need to use scenario I for the following exercise_

- Put the journalists into small groups and tell them that they are going to read a scenario
- Ask the journalists to work together to answer the question in the scenario and to plan out how best to protect the journalist.

## Case study

This case study accompanies the course material and provides journalists with real-life examples of digital threats against media workers. The case studies can be used to promote discussion around different types of risks as well as serve as a way to teach journalists steps to better protect themselves and others.
